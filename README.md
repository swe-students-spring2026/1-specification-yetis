## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder 1: Local Student
**Name:** Vincent Campanaro <br>
**Demographic:** 3rd year NYU student

**Goals and Needs:**
1. **Dish-Level Memory:** Needs a way to rate and remember specific menu items separately from the restaurant (ex: Vincent mentioned he has often had experiences where some dishes at a restaurant are good while others are not).
2. **Spice Tolerance Searching:** Vincent mentioned that he does not have a particularly high spice tolerance, so he wants to be made aware of restaurants that can cater to those with low spice tolerances (especially since Asian cuisine is known for having many spices).
3. **Restaurant Proximity:** Vincent wants to be able to filter restaurants based on proximity to campus and where he lives in the Financial District to minimize commute time as he is very busy.

**Problems and Frustrations:**
1. **Generic Ratings:** Frustrated by apps like Yelp or Google Maps that rate the entire restaurant rather than the specific foods themselves (ex: Vincent mentioned there are specific dishes he does not like at all but it might just be what a particular restaurant is known for).
2. **Forgetting the names of small, great restaurants:** Frequently forgets the names of small, "hole-in-the-wall" spots he visite or forgets specifically what he ordered from these spots that he liked so much (ex: Vincent mentioned that he recently tried a burrito spot in the West Village that was cheap and great but couldn't remember the name of it and therefore can't go there again).


### Stakeholder 2: Traveler
**Name:** Ved Mistry <br>
**Demographic:** Recent UC Berkeley graduate living in the Bay Area and ocassionally visiting NYC

**Goals and Needs:**
1. **See portion sizes ahead of time:** Needs to see user-uploaded photos of specific dishes to be able to see whether the retaurant has large portion sizes or not so he can get more bang for his buck.
2. **Share dining history:** Wants to be able to create a comprehensive dining history that he can share with his friends from the Bay for future NYC trips.

**Problems and Frustrations:**
1. **Indecisiveness** Frustrated by walking around dense food neighborhoods in NYC and being overwhelmed by options without knowing which specific dishes are must-haves in the limited time he usually has in the city.
2. **Mismatch between pictures and restaurant names:** Dislikes having his camera roll filled with random photos without being able to tell where he had a specific food.

## Product Vision Statement

Your personal journal for NYC’s best Asian eats - dish by dish, and not just place by place.

## User Requirements
### User Type 1: Local Student
1. As a Local Student, I want to search for specific dishes (e.g., "Pad See Ew") rather than just restaurant names so that I can find the best version of the foods I already know I love.

2. As a Local Student, I want to filter restaurants by specific regional cuisines (e.g., "Szechuan" vs. "Chinese") so that I can find distinct flavors and avoid generic options.

3. As a Local Student, I want to rate individual menu items separately from the restaurant so that I remember specifically what to order (and what to avoid) next time I visit.

4. As a Local Student, I want to assign a precise "Spice Level" rating to dishes so that I can track my tolerance and identify spots that match my preference.

5. As a Local Student, I want to share a direct link to my dish reviews via text so that I can quickly recommend good, affordable spots to friends without copy-pasting lists.

6. As a Local Student, I want to upload photos of my meals attached to specific reviews so that I have a visual log of my dining history.

7. As a Local Student, I want to view a map of highly-rated specific dishes near my campus or dorm so that I can quickly decide where to eat between classes.

8. As a Local Student, I want to add detailed notes to my logs so that I can reference portion sizes or prices when deciding where to go next.

9. As a Local Student, I want to edit my past reviews so that I can update my ratings if a restaurant’s quality or prices change over the semester.

10. As a Local Student, I want to save "Favorite Dishes" so that I can build a rotating list of go-to meals.

### User Type 2: Traveler
1. As a Traveler, I want to search for specific local dishes so that I can ensure I am trying the "must-have" food of that region, rather than just a popular restaurant.

2. As a Traveler, I want to filter results by authentic regional sub-cuisines so that I can experience the true local culture and avoid tourist traps.

3. As a Traveler, I want to view a map of specific, top-rated dishes near my current location so that I can make a high-quality food decision instantly while walking around a new city.

4. As a Traveler, I want to see photos of specific dishes (not just the venue) so that I can visually verify if the portion and style match what I am looking for before ordering.

5. As a Traveler, I want to upload photos of my meals so that I can create a visually rich timeline of my trip's culinary experiences.

6. As a Traveler, I want to share a direct link to my curated list of reviews so that I can act as a guide for friends visiting the same city later.

7. As a Traveler, I want to check the "Spice Level" rating of local dishes so that I can be adventurous without ruining my day with food that is too hot.

8. As a Traveler, I want to see a chronological history of everywhere I have eaten so that I can retrace my steps and remember the names of the places I visited.

9. As a Traveler, I want to add additional text notes to my logs so that I can look over them when deciding where to go eat next during my trip.

10. As a Traveler, I want to edit my review if I revisit a spot during my trip and have a different experience (better or worse).
